Airbrake Ruby is a plain Ruby notifier for Airbrake (https://airbrake.io), the
leading exception reporting service. Airbrake Ruby provides minimalist API that
enables the ability to send any Ruby exception to the Airbrake dashboard. The
library is extremely lightweight, contains no dependencies and perfectly suits
plain Ruby applications. For apps that are built with Rails, Sinatra or any
other Rack-compliant web framework we offer the airbrake gem
(https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake). It has additional features such as
reporting of any unhandled exceptions automatically, integrations with Resque,
Sidekiq, Delayed Job and many more.
